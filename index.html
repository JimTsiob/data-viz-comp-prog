      A human mind is capable of many things. One of these, is to solve complex logical problems given a set of
      constraints and within a time limit. Using computer code to achieve that with the best possible performance
      is the concept of <i id="cp">competitive programming</i>. This type of sport became famous through competitions
      (e.g. Google Code Jam) where programmers competed for awards and through YouTube channels where users recorded
      themselves solving problems (in websites like LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.). It is also common nowadays for a job
      candidate to be asked to solve similar kind of problems during the coding interview.
      <br><br>
      Like every sport, CP (competitive programming) has its own champions. Below are 2 of the most well known
      "athletes".

            <p>
              Gennady Korotkevich is a Belarussian competitive programmer. He has won major international competitions
              since the age of 11, as well as numerous national competitions. His top accomplishments include six
              consecutive
              gold medals in the International Olympiad in Informatics as well as the world championship in the 2013 and
              2015
              International Collegiate Programming Contest World
              Finals.
              <br><br>
              As of October 2023, Gennady was the highest-rated programmer on Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, AtCoder
              and
              HackerRank. In January 2022, he achieved a historic rating of 3979 on Codeforces, becoming the first to
              break
              the 3900 barrier. His current rating is 3843 and he uses C++ 20 to solve his programming problems.
              <br><br>
              At this time, he's studying for his PhD in ITMO, one of Russia's top universities.

              Other accomplishments include William being 2nd place in 2019 International Olympiad of Informatics (IOI),
              1st place in 2020 IOI and having a Grandmaster rank in every Competitive Programming website.
              His current rating is 2931 (International Grandmaster) in Codeforces and 2916 (7 stars) in Codechef.He
              also
              uses C++ 20 to solve programming problems.

      This website showcases some visualizations that provide information and facts about CP. Along with each diagram,
      we have included a succinct analysis of it and what knowledge can one extract from studying it. Possible
      justifications of the results may also be written.
      <br>
      <br>
      We classified 5 categories with the data we had available. This helped us break down our visualizations into
      smaller domains and work independently. These categories are: programming language, problem/solution, time, memory
      and website. We explain each category in its dedicated page.
    </p>

    <p class="project-desc">
      <b class="project-header">"Target group"</b><br>
      We have 2 kinds of audiences, one bigger and one smaller. The bigger one are the people with an interest in
      programming and the smaller one are the CodeChef's managers (we could say we are "playing" in both B2C and B2B
      fields). This separation occurs from the classification we talked in the previous section. The first four domains
      aim the former group (even though CodeChef can utilize the knowledge) and the last one (i.e. the website category)
      aims the latter group.
    </p>

    <p class="project-desc">
      <b class="project-header">Process</b><br>
      Our team analyzed a dataset from Kaggle that contained data collected from CodeChef, a site to solve coding
      problems. Specifically, we had 1474 problems and more than 1 million solutions to these. Namely, some features
      from both sheets are problem's level, tags, user's solutions, solution's status, etc. Each team member worked
      independently in his category. Nevertheless, we had already discussed what visualizations we wanted and how we
      would achieve that in terms of processing data, what type of diagram to use, etc..
