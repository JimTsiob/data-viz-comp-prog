    <p id="paragraphLibre">
      This page contains diagrams related to the programming languages that users picked
      to solve the problems. Generally, four are mostly picked among others which makes
      sense due to their speed and their pre-existing popularity. We must note that some
      languages with low usage couldn't be presented in a clean way and were ruining the
      general image of the visualization. For that, we grouped all these in a single category
      and called it <i>OTHER</i>. This is not a problem because we wanted to visualize the bigger
      picture.

      <h3 class="plot-title language-color">Solution per language</h3>
      <p class="plot-desc">
        To get a quick overview, we start by investigating which languages are mostly picked among programmers to solve
        these problems. This, would indirectly show us which ones are more suitable for competitive programming.
        <br><br>
        As one can see in the donut chart, C++ is used in most solutions with 51.1% and then goes C with 29.1%. Both
        languages are known for their good time performance. Next come JAVA and PYTHON. We understand that competitive
        programmers code with languages that are faster even though they have more verbosity instead of coding with
        syntactically simpler ones but being slower (like PYTHON). We can also note that OOP (Object Oriented
        Programming) languages are choosed over functional. In the middle, we put the total number of submissions which
        is 1,008,078.

    <div class="inner-plot-group left-text-aling">
      <h3 class="plot-title language-color">Lines Of Code per language</h3>
      <p class="plot-desc">
        As the title says, this bar chart visualizes how many Lines of Code (LoC) on average are written with a
        language.
        <br><br>
        Results are presented in ascending order, starting with TEXT and finishing with C++. TEXT is nothing
        more than a simple text file that CodeChef accepts as solution for a specific category of problems. The 3
        languages with the most lines are C++ followed by JAVA and C. These is because of their verbose nature to
        express things when writing code. Opposingly, TCL, HASK and PERL have the fewer LoC.
        <br><br>
        Of course, this metric can be influenced by the personal style of each developer. For example, one may put new
        line after opening left curly bracket, or break the code into small methods which results in more lines. One
        more possible factor is that users coding in those languages engage more often in harder problems that require
        lengthier solutions.

      <h3 class="plot-title language-color">Changed Preferences</h3>
      <p class="plot-desc">
        For the final visualization of this section, we found interesting to see how many users moved from their initial
        coding language to another. The Chord chart was the best fit for this purpose. Hovering over a line displays
        details.
        <br><br>
        In general, most programmers that started with a language, kept coding in it. C++ was the language to welcome
        the most newcomers from other languages while keeping its majority of users (almost 22,000). 5,508 programmers
        changed from C to C++, probably because the latter is a superset of the former, so the transition was not
        difficult. In contrast, 1,751 people moved from C++ to C. "Population exchanges" between the rest of the
        languages ranged from 0 to 800.
        <br><br>
        To measure this, we kept for each competitor his first and last submission based on datetime from all problems
        and checked if there was a change in the language he used.
