    <p id="paragraphLibre">
      This section showcases diagrams related to the memory that programmers' solutions occupy. Memory, also known as
      space, is the second efficacy criteria to consider when assessing the quality of a solution, especially for
      problems in competitive programming. One must watch out to use as little as possible when implementing an
      algorithm but also utilize that space correctly. It is also important to always balance time and space
      complexities so as not to face problems in one of the two categories.

      <h3 class="plot-title memory-color">Average memory taken per language</h3>
      <p class="plot-desc">
        In this graph, we visualize the average memory usage(MB) of the most used programming languages in competitive
        programming.
        On the left side, we see languages like C, C++, and Python taking up minimal memory, this show us the efficiency in
        terms of memory usage.
        As we move to the right, the memory usage increases significantly, with Java, Scala and GO showing the highest
        memory consumption.
        While these languages may offer rich features and capabilities, they can be more demanding on system resources,
        which could be critical in competitive programming where memory constraints are often very strict. With that in
        mind, choosing a language
        like C, C++, Python, or Ruby might be more advantageous for memory-sensitive tasks in competitive environments.

      <h3 class="plot-title memory-color">Average memory taken per difficulty</h3>
      <p class="plot-desc">
        This graph shows the average memory(MB) usage of competitive programming problems based on their difficulty
        level.
        For beginner and easy problems, the average memory usage range is around 100 MB, showing us that these problems
        typically don't
        require much memory. As we move to medium difficulty, the memory usage slightly decreases. However,
        hard problems show a big spike, with average memory usage peaking around 150 MB, showing their complexity and
        the need for
        more resources. A very interesting note is that the problems in category "challenge", which are the toughest,
        show lower memory usage
        than every other category, suggesting that while they are complex, they might be optimized for efficiency.
        This graph can help competitors better plan their approach and resource management based on the difficulty level
        of the
        problems they are trying to solve.
