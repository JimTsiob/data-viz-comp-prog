    <h2 id="font34">Number of accepted solutions per level</h2>
    <div id="diagramContainer">
        <p id="font27"> Below, we will be presenting several visualizations regarding problem solutions.<br> 
            The first visualization shows a Bubble chart with the number of accepted solutions for each difficulty level in Codechef. <br>
            The result is, as expected, that the hardest level (challenge) solutions are the fewest in number due to the problems' difficulty <br>
            and the most accepted solutions are in the easy difficulty. <br>
            This means that users who are probably new to Competitive Programming do not go to beginner problems <br>
            as much and instead opt for something harder, to keep both the enjoyability of writing code <br> and simultaneously learning new ways to solve problems
            without burning their brains out.
