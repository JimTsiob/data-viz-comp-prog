      Conquer the code, master the competition.
      <br /><br />Below, we will be presenting several visualizations regarding problem solutions
    </p>
    </p>
  </div>


  <div class="plot-group tag reverse-order-mobile">
    <div class="inner-plot-group right-text-aling">
      <h3 class="plot-title problem-color">Number of accepted <br>solutions per level</h3>
      <p class="plot-desc">

        The first visualization is a Pie chart with the number of accepted solutions for each difficulty level in
        Codechef. <br>

        The result shows, as expected, that the hardest level (challenge) solutions are the fewest in number due to the
        problems' difficulty and the most accepted solutions are in the easy difficulty. This means that users who are
        probably new to Competitive Programming do not go to beginner problems as much and instead opt for something
        harder, to keep both the enjoyability of writing code and simultaneously learning new ways to solve problems
        without burning their brains out.

      <h3 class="plot-title problem-color">Tested vs Untested solutions</h3>
      <p class="plot-desc">
        Codechef, apart from having a fully automatic pipeline that compiles, runs and tests solutions, invites
        experienced users to run test cases for problems manually, create solutions and compensates them with a small
        amount of money for it! <br>
        With this visualization, we want to show the importance of Testing. Manual handling of test cases ensures that
        errors related to other factors than wrong code, such as wrong test case writing, are minimized or completely
        removed.<br>
        For accepted solutions, it is apparent that we have a larger amount of tested problems, which leads to the
        conclusion that this difference between tested and untested accepted solutions
        could be poorly written automated test cases, or wrong problem statements. <br>
        For programs that ended up with runtime-errors, tested programs are less than untested ones, indicating the
        advantages of manual testing.

    <div class="inner-plot-group right-text-aling">
      <h3 class="plot-title problem-color">Most difficult problems - Top 25</h3>
      <p class="plot-desc">

        Problems in codechef have two labels that distinguish them from each other, difficulty and tags. <br>
        Tags represent the type of algorithms that are required to solve a problem. The diagram shows the percentage of accepted solutions for each tag. <br>
        It is apparent that problems that relate to recursion and prime numbers are the most difficult to solve due to the low percentage of their solutions
        while problems that relate to sorting, binary search and algebra are easier to solve. <br>
        Overall, difficulty in the shown tags is high. The diagram shows that these problems have low percentages of accepted solutions in general, which means they're pretty difficult to solve.<br>
